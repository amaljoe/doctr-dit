      "['Summary', \"Is climate restoration an appropriate goal for humanity's response to climate change?\", 'Ambitious goals have long motivated climate policy.', 'For instance, the Paris Agreement calls for limiting the increase in the global average temperature to below 2℃.', \"Ambitious as they are, these goals would leave the Earth's climate greatly transformed for millennia.\", \"Thus,proponents have put forward the even more ambitious goal of climate restoration——aiming to return the Earth's climate toy its condition before the start of the Industrial Revolution.\", 'Proponents envision many types of climate restoration.', 'However,one of great interest—and the focus of this study—seeks to return greenhouse gas(GHG) concentrations to the preindustrial level of 300 parts per million within one to two generations.', 'Climate restoration proponents appear motivated by several factors,including the simplicity and purity of the goal; the potential for a grand challenge to catalyze innovation; and avoiding low-probability, high- consequence risks of extreme climate impacts.', 'On the other hand, climate restoration presents a monumental task, the pursuit of which is not without the potential to do harm by diverting resources away from other responses to climate change or by weakening commitment to other ambitious climate goals.', 'Therefore,this report considers climate restoration through the lens of risk management.', 'Defined broadly,risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives.', \"Risk management seeks to understand uncertainty's implications and take actions that enhance beneficial opportunities and reduce adverse risks.\", 'This broad definition emphasizes that risk management must often be conducted under conditions of deep uncertainty, in which the parties affected by and acting on the risks do not know or agree on the likelihoods of alternative futures or how their actions are related to consequences.', 'Even without a restoration goal, climate change presents an archetypal challenge of risk management under deep uncertainty.', 'Adding climate restoration makes risk management under deep uncertainty even more relevant.', 'To help judge the appropriateness of a climate restoration goal, we use an augmented version of the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model to explore the consequences of pursuing climate restoration over a wide range of plausible futures, with differing assumptions about the cost and performance of technologies that extract carbon from the atmosphere,the cost and performance of GHG mitigation technologies, and the seriousness of unmitigated climate change.', 'Despite numerous simplifications——including a focus on direct air capture (DAC) as representing a much larger suite of proposed approaches—the analysis draws useful conclusions about futures in which climate restoration might prove possible and in which the pursuit of climate restoration might prove catalytic.', 'If climate restoration proves possible, that is, if society manages to return to preindustrial atmospheric concentrations at reasonable cost, it would reduce the risk of extreme climate', 'viii']\n",
      "['impacts and make meeting other climate goals more likely.', \"Successful climate restoration would require achieving future cost and performance of DAC technology equivalent to today's most optimistic assumptions.\", 'If the pursuit of climate restoration proves catalytic(i.e.,increases the likelihood of widespread deployment of negative emissions technologies),it could open much- needed technology pathways for reducing climate risks-in particular,additional pathways for meeting the 2℃ goal.', 'However,even if the pursuit of climate restoration increases the likelihood of DAC deployment,it could also reduce the likelihood of decarbonization so as to counteract any overall beneficial effects.', 'This study suggests that pursuing climate restoration would avoid such moral hazard,that is,provide a net catalytic effect,under conditions in which successful DAC is at least half as likely as successful decarbonization.', 'The analysis also suggests that near-term actions to help manage any risks form climate restoration might include combining such goals with a 2℃ target to reduce the risk of overshoot and developing appropriate long-term financing mechanisms for what might become an expensive public good', 'In addition,the model dynamics suggest that an ambitious climate restoration goal might seek to achieve preindustrial concentrations toward the end of the 21st century,perhaps around 2075-by some reckonings,the 300th anniversary of the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.', 'ix']\n",
